PROBLEMS:
    * Classification over 1kk classes

    * Classification with very small numbers of samples for each class
        - google article
            - hard to unserstand
            - hard to implement
            - ???
        - random forest 
            - may be bad for over 1k classes
            - good enough for start

    * Samples filtering (dirty samples)
        - K-means (two classes) through one class samples
            - bearing sample is needed
            - good descriptor(s) is needed

    * Image parsing

    * Social crawler
