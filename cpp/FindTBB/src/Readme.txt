FindTBB example project

To make this project compile, copy the file sub_string_finder.cpp from Intel's
TBB examples into this directory.

The file was not included by me because I am uncertain if I am allowed to.
Intel's sub_string_finder.cpp is released under the GPL while FindTBB.cmake is
released under the MIT license
